# Condominium Management System

The Condominium Management System is a web-based platform designed to streamline the management of rental properties, including condominiums. The system allows property owners to list their units for rent and facilitates seamless interactions between property owners and renters. It integrates Vue.js for the frontend and Laravel for the backend.

## Features

- **Rental Management**: Easily manage rental listings, including details such as location, number of bedrooms, floor, area, and price.
- **Image Uploads**: Upload and store images for each rental unit.
- **Dynamic Rental Listings**: Display rental listings dynamically on the frontend with data fetched from the backend.
- **Tenant Notifications**: Notify property owners when a customer applies for a rental unit.
- **Secure Payment Integration**: Facilitate payments through secure third-party payment gateways like Chapa.
- **User Authentication**: Protect endpoints and data with secure user authentication and authorization.

## Prerequisites

To run the system, ensure you have the following installed:

- PHP >= 8.0
- Composer
- Node.js and npm
- Laravel Framework 11.35.0
